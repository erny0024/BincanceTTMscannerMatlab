# BincanceTTMscannerMatlab
Rough Matlab Code to scann for coins that are currently in a TTM squeeze on binance.
Currently the 1d squeeze-function does not work.
The software is really slow and messy, will work on cleaning it (I'm very much a noob coder).
The file AppCreation.m is the file to run to test it out!
